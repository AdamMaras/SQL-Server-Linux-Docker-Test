# SQL-Server-Linux-Docker-Test
Creating my own image that uses sql server linux
For some reason, this shuts down after running the sql commands.
I compared it to https://github.com/twright-msft/mssql-node-docker-demo-app  and don't see much difference except that he is running a web app so the container is being forced to stay running.
